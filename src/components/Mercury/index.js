              Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. Due to its proximity,
              it's not easily seen except during twilight. For every two orbits
              of the Sun, Mercury completes three rotations about its axis. Up
              until 1965 it was thought that the same side of Mercury constantly
              faced the Sun.
