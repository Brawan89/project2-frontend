            The Solar System consists of the Sun and its planetary system of
            eight planets, their moons, and other non-stellar objects. It formed
            4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant
            molecular cloud. All planets have almost circular orbits that lie
            within a nearly flat disc called the ecliptic plane.
